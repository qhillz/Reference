[WebGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL) is a JavaScript API, or *programmable interface*, for drawing interactive 2D and 3D graphics in web pages.

WebGL connects your web browser up to your device’s graphics card, providing you with far more graphical processing power than is available on a traditional website.
